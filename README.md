# CSE134-hw2-hw5
I decided that even though it was sort of minimal, the overall design of my initial website would also match the final deployment, so that it's something that shows both my progress through the class as well as my ability to deliver on the product I promised. This led to most of my changes being stylistic, such as filling in information on the page, fixing issues caused by implemening part 2 (off centered p elements because I had to edit the properties of the p tag in part 2), and most notably fixing buttons and reviewing my color scheme (after the grade from hw3 came out and I was told that my color scheme made it hard to see the content of my page). I decided to also switch the display of my buttons, as they were originally stacked on top of each other, which I thought would be nicely fixable through switching the display mode to flex. I think I cleaned the website up enough to a point where I believe that with just a few small tweaks depending on the professionality of the people looking at it, it's something that I am not embarrassed to have a prospective employer see.

(Moved to main branch because the instructions asked to "Make sure the README will be readable immediately upon opening your repo on Github".
